## 1. Setting up the Environment
- Installed Kali Linux on VirtualBox.
- Learned how to split-screen terminals on Windows 11 (Snap Layouts).
- Created this GitHub repository to document my journey.

## 2. File Permissions (chmod)
I practiced securing files using the `chmod` command.
- **`chmod 755 admin_tool.sh`**: Made a script executable (rwx for me, rx for others).
- **`chmod 600 secret_file.txt`**: Secured a file so *only* I can read/write it.
- **`chmod 644 public_read.txt`**: Standard permissions (I can edit, everyone else can read).

## 3. Output Redirection (echo)
I learned to create files directly from the command line without opening a text editor.
- **`>` (Overwrite)**: Created `kunle.txt` and added the first line.
- **`>>` (Append)**: Added a second line to the file without deleting the first one.
